# Detection-of-Thyroid-Nodules-Using-Deep-Learning
The system improves early detection accuracy by analysing texture, shape, and pixel variations that are often difficult to detect manually. This project demonstrates my ability to handle medical datasets, preprocess ultrasound images, optimise CNN architectures, and deploy AI models for healthcare applications.
